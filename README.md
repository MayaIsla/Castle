# Castle

Create a complex of connected rooms.  Read in the vertices and edges from files. 
Allow the user to move around the complex by going North, South, East, and West.  
Implement Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path to a user selected room.  
Have the option to show the adjacency list after running Dijkstra's.
